kadane-adv: Advanced Subarray Optimization Library for Python
-------------------------------------------------------------

kadane-adv is a Python package that extends the classic Kadane’s Algorithm to support 
advanced use cases in 1D and 2D data analysis. Designed for performance and simplicity, 
it provides efficient and expressive tools for identifying optimal subarrays and submatrices 
from various types of data—be it time series, financial data, sensor logs, or image matrices.

It serves as a practical, real-world tool for extracting meaningful patterns from data, 
making it an essential utility for data analysts, researchers, and machine learning developers.

Main Features
===============================================================================
Here are some of the key capabilities of kadane-adv:

- 1D Maximum Subarray Detection
  Find the subarray with the highest sum in linear time.

- 2D Maximum Submatrix Detection
  Extend the algorithm to rectangular regions of 2D matrices.

- Constrained Optimization
  Extract optimal subarrays with minimum length or other constraints.

- Built-in Visualization
  Instantly visualize the identified optimal subarray within the original data.

- Integration with NumPy and Pandas
